# Senderrplace v2 Feature Matrix

This matrix aligns the existing Marketplace experience with the Senderrplace v2 vision so we can methodically replace the marketplace surface with Senderrplace-specific flows and branding.

## Key Categories
| Category | Marketplace Reference | Senderrplace v2 Goal | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browse & Discover | `docs/project-plan/04-PHASE-2-MARKETPLACE.md` (Browse & Search section), `apps/marketplace-app/src/components/browse`, `pages/marketplace/Home` (via `pages/layout.tsx` and `pages/jobs`). | Rebrand the landing experience with Senderrplace styling, highlight curated collections, featured merchants, and location-pin search while reusing current grid, filters, and sort logic. | 1. Audit current browse components and map each to a Senderrplace landing section. 2. Reuse `ItemCard`, `ItemGrid`, `SearchBar`, `CategoryFilter`, `SortDropdown`. 3. Define new hero/call-to-action sections and placeholder promotions. |
| Item Details & Listings | `docs/project-plan/04-PHASE-2-MARKETPLACE.md` (Item Details). `apps/marketplace-app/src/pages/marketplace/[item]`, `components/buy/ItemDetails.tsx`, `features/listings`. | Ensure Senderrplace item detail pages surface the same photos, price, condition tags, delivery options, seller profile, and similar items. Update meta data (og tags) to reference Senderrplace. | 1. Identify existing detail page routes/components. 2. Prepare a decorator for seller profile cards that include Senderrplace trust indicators. 3. Review metadata generation and update branding strings. |
| Buy & Checkout | `pages/checkout/*`, `features/checkout`, `firebase/functions/stripe`. | Keep the buy/pre-checkout flows but surface Senderrplace-specific messaging, payment terms, and courier tracking tie-ins. Confirm Checkout pages still support order summaries, delivery slots, and saved cards. | 1. Verify `createPaymentIntent`/`marketplaceCheckout` functions remain compatible; note where to swap domain naming. 2. Update checkout page copy + CTA. 3. Ensure tracking/timeline components (`OrderTracking`, `OrderSummary`) remain intact and highlight Senderrplace branding. |
| Seller & Listing Management | `pages/seller`, `components/sell`, `features/inventory`. | Map seller dashboard, listing creation, and inventory views to Senderrplace; add new hero for onboarding merchants. | 1. Inventory: ensure forms (photos, condition, delivery options) remain and mention Senderrplace payouts. 2. Dashboard: confirm metrics, revenue, pending orders, and performance (views, favorites). 3. Add instructions/links for booking link generation (Senderrplace domain contract). |
| Messaging & Support | `pages/messages`, `components/messages/ConversationList`, `docs/project-plan/04` (Messaging System). | Retain real-time chat but re-theme for Senderrplace (color palette, text). | 1. Extract message UI strings for rebrand. 2. Verify quick replies, read receipts, and order context are still provided by the same components (likely under `features/messages`). |
| Ratings & Reviews | `pages/reviews`, `features/reviews`. | Maintain rating flows while ensuring badge text references Senderrplace values (Verified, Response time, Completion rate). | 1. Confirm data sources for rating stats and ensure Senderrplace profile trusts (seller rating display, rating counts). |
| Profile & Settings | `pages/profile`, `pages/settings`, `components/profile`. | Provide Senderrplace profile sections (bio, badges, rating summary, member since) and keep buyer/seller settings intact. | 1. Review profile data shapes for buyer/seller roles. 2. Update copy (e.g., `gosenderr-marketplace` → `Senderrplace`). 3. Plan support for feature flags from `docs/senderr_app/FEATURE_FLAGS.md` where relevant. |
| Order & Delivery Operations | `pages/orders`, `components/order`, `firebase/functions/triggers` (notifications, capture/refund, ratings enforcement). | Keep order timeline, dispatch status, and delivery tracking but call the experience Senderrplace. | 1. Document trigger dependencies (autoCancel, sendNotifications). 2. Identify where domain-specific copy exists and grid for turning into Senderrplace content. |
| Admin & Feature Flags | `docs/senderr_app/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`, `docs/project-plan/02`, `firebase/functions/src/senderrplace`. | Align admin dashboards/feature flags to new domain and ensure `marketplace_v2`, `seller_portal_v2`, and other flags stay active for Senderrplace rollout. | 1. Confirm hosting site `gosenderr-marketplace` will point to Senderrplace once ready. 2. Document flag creation/updates. 3. Review `firebase/functions/src/senderrplace/domainContract.ts` for necessary calls from the web app.

## Observations
- Most Marketplace functionality already exists inside `apps/marketplace-app`; replacing it with Senderrplace is primarily a rebrand + configuration/messaging effort coupled with Senderrplace-specific domain contracts (booking links, merchant directory) in Firestore functions.
- Senderrplace introduces booking links and merchant fingerprinting logic; ensure UI surfaces those features (e.g., via a dedicated onboarding flow or button in the seller dashboard).
- To minimize risk we can keep the current routing/feature structure and progressively swap branding strings + hosting target while using the existing Firebase functions for payments/orders.

## Next Steps
1. Create a Senderrplace-branded app shell (maybe by extending `apps/marketplace-app` or sharing components + a new entry point) and update `README`/`docs` to call it Senderrplace v2.
2. Begin rebranding components (home hero, listing cards, CTA) to highlight Senderrplace while keeping feature parity with Marketplace.
3. Align Firebase Hosting, feature flags, and Stripe references so the transition from `gosenderr-marketplace` to Senderrplace is transparent once ready.
4. Track invites/QA tasks (bookings, messaging, ratings) for final verification.

Further detail can be added as we start editing specific screens or migrating config files.
